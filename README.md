# aContextReasoner
An Android Context Reasoner, originally developed as part of the EU Project, POSEIDON (http://www.poseidon-project.org). This reasoner allows for applications to infer different contexts and situations. It is being designed to be fully extensible at runtime by third party mobile applications.

While I was the sole developer of the version developed for POSEIDON, this version can be considered a fork of the original work (which can be found at: https://github.com/GOODIES-RG/POSEIDON-Context)

As I am no longer a MDX Employee, I continue to develop this reasoner as a hobby, and I am open to suggestions to improve it.
